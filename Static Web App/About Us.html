        On July 31, 1990, Harry D. R. Cliffe opened Harry's Pottery Store in Clay County, North Carolina. Our original
        store was located at the intersection of Kiln Street and Silica Road. On June 26, 1997, we moved to our current location
        on Phil Stone Avenue and have been here ever since.

    <p>
        Harry's Pottery Store has been family owned since 1990.
